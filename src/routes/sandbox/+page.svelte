	Explore Linku's <b>sandbox</b>, a collection of proposed words which are
	<em>not actively in use</em>. Some of these words are of value to the
	community as pieces of culture, essentially memes. Some reflect early drafts
	of Toki Pona. Many are one-off jokes, created and abandoned immediately.

	<strong>Warning!</strong>
	If you are a learner, <em>stick to the main dictionary</em>. These words
	will not help you speak the language.
